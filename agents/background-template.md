## Research Log

### Search: "your exact search query here"

- **Key finding one** with inline citation ([First Source Title][1])
- **Key finding two** from a different source ([Second Source Title][2])
- Supporting detail, confirmed across sources ([First Source Title][1], [Second Source Title][2])

> "Direct quotes go in blockquotes when the exact wording matters." ([First Source Title][1])

**Follow-up questions:**
- What remains unclear or worth digging into next?
- Any contradictions to resolve?

---

### Search: "second search query"

- **New finding** from a newly discovered source ([New Source][3])
- Detail that **contradicts** earlier finding from Search 1 — noting both views ([New Source][3] vs [First Source Title][1])

**Follow-up questions:**
- Next thread to pull on
